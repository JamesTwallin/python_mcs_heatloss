        (e.g., living room to hall, to bedrooms, etc.). Our implementation follows
        the MCS Excel calculator which treats each room independently.

        - Total Heat Loss: 3,339.99 W (includes inter-room transfers)

        - Living Room Heat Loss: 1,179.47 W (includes transfers to 6 adjacent rooms)
