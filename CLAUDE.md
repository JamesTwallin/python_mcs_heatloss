# MCS Heat Pump Calculator - Development Notes

## Project Overview

This project is a Python implementation of the MCS (Microgeneration Certification Scheme) Heat Pump Calculator, originally provided as an Excel spreadsheet (Version 1.10). The calculator performs heat loss calculations following BS EN 12831-1:2017 for domestic heat pump system design.

**Key Achievement**: The implementation now supports **both MCS Excel-style calculations AND heatlossjs-compatible inter-room heat transfer**, providing maximum flexibility for thermal modeling.

## Implementation Details

### Architecture

The implementation is structured into three main modules:

1. **calculator.py**: Main `HeatPumpCalculator` class that orchestrates calculations
2. **room.py**: Data classes for buildings, rooms, and fabric elements (walls, windows, floors) with inter-room heat transfer support
3. **data_tables.py**: Lookup tables and reference data (degree days, U-values, default temperatures)

### Key Design Decisions

#### Object-Oriented Approach
- Used dataclasses for clean, type-safe data structures
- Separate classes for different fabric elements (Wall, Window, Floor) with shared interface
- Room class encapsulates all heat loss calculations for a single space
- Building class aggregates multiple rooms and handles inter-room heat transfer
- **Wall class supports flexible boundaries**: external, ground, unheated, or adjacent room names

#### Calculation Methods
All calculations follow BS EN 12831 methodology with inter-room heat transfer extension:

**Fabric Heat Loss (Watts)**:
```python
Q = Σ (A × U × ΔT × f)
```
- A: area (m²)
- U: U-value (W/m²K)
- ΔT: internal - external temperature (K) OR (room - adjacent_room) for inter-room
- f: temperature correction factor (e.g., 0.5 for ground floors, 1.0 for external walls)

**Inter-Room Heat Transfer (Watts)**:
```python
Q_inter_room = A × U × (T_room - T_adjacent)
```
- Calculated separately for each wall with adjacent room boundary
- Supports heat loss (positive) or heat gain (negative) between rooms
- Compatible with heatlossjs methodology

**Ventilation Heat Loss (Watts)**:
```python
Q = 0.33 × n × V × ΔT
```
- 0.33: specific heat capacity of air (Wh/m³K)
- n: air change rate (ACH)
- V: room volume (m³)
- ΔT: temperature difference (K)

**Annual Energy (kWh)**:
```python
E = Q × DD × 24 / 1000
```
- Q: heat loss per degree difference (W/K)
- DD: degree days
- 24: hours per day
- 1000: convert Wh to kWh

#### Data Extraction from Excel

The Excel file analysis revealed:
- 47 sheets total
- Key sheets:
  - "Design Details": Main input/output sheet
  - "Post Code Degree Days": CIBSE degree days data for 124 UK postcode areas
  - Sheets "1" through "30": Individual room calculation templates
  - "floor u values": U-value calculation helpers
  - "Design Tables": Reference data

Data extraction process:
1. Used `openpyxl` to read Excel file structure
2. Extracted degree days data to Python dictionary
3. Identified calculation patterns from room sheets
4. Replicated formula logic in Python methods

### Module Details

#### `data_tables.py`

**DegreeDays Class**:
- Static lookup table with 124 UK postcode areas
- Methods: `get_degree_days()`, `get_design_temp()`, `get_location()`

**FloorUValues Class**:
- Implements BS EN 12831 floor U-value calculation
- Handles both solid and suspended floors
- Calculates characteristic dimension B = A / (0.5 × P)
- Different formulas based on B value

**RoomTemperatures Class**:
- Default design temperatures by room type
- Based on BS EN 12831 recommendations
- Lounge/Dining: 21°C, Bedrooms: 18°C, Bathrooms: 22°C

**VentilationRates Class**:
- Natural ventilation rates (ACH) by building category
- Category A: Higher rates (older buildings)

- Generates comprehensive summary with room-by-room breakdown

#### `calculator.py`

**HeatPumpCalculator Class**:
Main interface with methods for:

- `create_room()`: Create room with defaults based on type
- `calculate_building_heat_loss()`: Complete building calculation

- `get_location_info()`: Location data summary

### Testing Strategy

Comprehensive test suite in `tests/test_calculator.py`:

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Degree days lookup
   - Floor U-value calculations
   - Room temperature defaults
   - Individual heat loss components

2. **Component Tests**:
   - Room fabric loss
   - Ventilation loss
   - Thermal bridging
   - Total heat loss

3. **Integration Tests**:
   - Complete building calculations
   - Full system design workflow
   - Multi-room buildings

4. **Validation Tests**:
   - Known values (e.g., degree days for specific postcodes)
   - Calculation formulas
   - Physical constraints (e.g., U-values > 0)

All 20 tests pass successfully.

### Example Usage

The `example_usage.py` script demonstrates:
- Creating a 6-room bungalow in Manchester
- Room-by-room heat loss calculation
- Hot water energy calculation
- Heat pump sizing

- Annual space heating: ~7,000 kWh
- Annual hot water: ~4,000 kWh
- Total annual energy: ~11,000 kWh
- With COP 3.5: ~3,300 kWh electricity, ~£1,000/year

### Validation Against Excel

The Python implementation produces results consistent with the Excel calculator methodology:

**Test Case - Simple Room**:
- Room: 5m × 6m × 2.4m (30 m³)
- Wall: 12 m² @ U=0.3 W/m²K
- External temp: -2°C, Internal: 21°C
- Expected fabric loss: 12 × 0.3 × 23 = 82.8 W ✓
- Expected vent loss (1.5 ACH): 0.33 × 1.5 × 30 × 23 = 341.55 W ✓

### Usage Patterns

**Basic Usage**:
```python
calc = HeatPumpCalculator(postcode_area='M')
building = calc.create_building('My House')
room = calc.create_room('Lounge', 'Lounge', floor_area=25)
# ... add fabric elements ...
summary = calc.calculate_building_heat_loss()
```

**Advanced Usage**:
```python
# Custom room parameters
room = Room(
    name='Custom Room',
    room_type='Lounge',
    design_temp=20,
    volume=40,
    air_change_rate=0.8,
    thermal_bridging_factor=0.10
)

# Custom fabric with temperature factor
floor = Floor(
    name='Basement Floor',
    area=30,
    u_value=0.20,
    temperature_factor=0.3  # Unheated basement below
)
```

### Known Limitations

1. **Simplified Floor U-values**: Uses BS EN 12831 simplified method, not detailed FEA
2. **Natural Ventilation Only**: Mechanical ventilation with heat recovery not included
3. **Single Temperature Zone**: Each room treated independently
4. **Steady-State**: Dynamic effects not modeled
5. **UK-Specific**: Degree days data only for UK postcode areas

### Maintenance Notes

**Updating Degree Days Data**:
Edit `DegreeDays.DATA` dictionary in `data_tables.py`

**Adding New Room Types**:
Edit `RoomTemperatures.TEMPERATURES` dictionary

**Modifying Calculation Methods**:
Update methods in `Room` class, ensure tests are updated

**Version Updates**:
Update `__version__` in `mcs_calculator/__init__.py`

## Conclusion

This Python implementation successfully replicates the core heat loss calculation functionality of the MCS Heat Pump Calculator Excel spreadsheet, with improved:
- Testability (20 automated tests)
- Maintainability (modular, typed, documented code)
- Usability (simple API, programmatic access)
- Extensibility (easy to add features)

The implementation is production-ready for heat loss calculations and heat pump system design following BS EN 12831 methodology.
